# Abstract

This project focuses on developing predictive models for **hourly electricity consumption** using data gathered from 100 buildings across multiple global sites. 
Each record combines:

- **Building Metadata:**  
  - `primary_use` (EnergyStar category)  
  - `square_feet` (gross floor area)  
  - `year_built`  
  - `floor_count`  

- **Weather Conditions:**  
  - `air_temperature`  
  - `cloud_coverage`  
  - `dew_temperature`  
  - `precip_depth_1_hr`  
  - `sea_level_pressure`  
  - `wind_direction`  
  - `wind_speed`  

- **Target Variable:**  
  - `meter_reading` in kWh  

The goal is to accurately forecast electricity usage by leveraging building attributes and environmental factors. This involves:

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
   - Identifying and handling anomalies (e.g., outliers or missing data)  
   - Aligning time zones, if necessary  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Time-based features (hour of day, day of week, seasonal indicators)  
   - Weather-derived features (temperature lags, smoothed variables)  
   - Building characteristics (floor area, year built, etc.)  

3. **Model Development**  
   - **Gradient Boosted Trees** (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost)  
   - **Random Forests**  
   - **Neural Networks** (LSTMs)  
   - **Ensembles** (stacking or averaging multiple models)  

By evaluating these approaches with appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, or RMSLE), we seek to provide actionable insights for energy management and cost optimization. Ultimately, the project aims to enable data-driven decisions, enhance operational efficiency, and contribute to sustainable building operations.
